JavaScript MA03
----------------
Level 2

1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.
Couldn't find anything around this question, so I am guessing that it is the unwritten laws and norms to write a pretty and readable JavaScript code. For example using and not using capital letters in the correct places. 

2. What is a Regular Expression?
Regular Expression is a way to determine what the string should/can contain. By using Regular Expressions you can create patterns to help validate a string.

3. What does the .random() method do?
The .random() method returns a random floating-point number between 0 and 1.

4. What does the .sort() method do?
The .sort() method sorts the items of an array,  either alphabetically or numerically, in ascending or descending order. 

5. What does the .reverse() method do?
The .reverse() method reverses the order of elements in an array.

6. List two examples of bad JavaScript code.
Two examples of bad JavaScript code is using two equality-signs as comparison operators (var num == 2), and global variables because they are slow and can be easily overwritten.

7. What data types can a JSON object contain?
The data types a JSON object can contain are objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans and null. 

8. What is minifying JavaScript Code?
Minifying JavaScript Code is to short down the code by removing unnecessary content. For example not using curly brackets in if-statements if you don't need it, or using shorter variable and function names.

9. What is a global variable?
A global variable is a variable that is accessible to all scopes within a JavaScript file.
